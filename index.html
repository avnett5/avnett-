<center><p> Howdy and welcome to my website! My name is Avnett Kaur Reshminder Singh and I was born and brought up in Malaysia. Right now, I am majoring in technology management and minoring in business. I am in my fourth year of college, which is senior year. Most importantly I am the loudest and the proud member of the Fighting Texas <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/"> Aggie </a> Class of 2018. On this website, I am going to share a little bit about my life and my experiences. I am very fun and outgoing person. I love meeting new people and learning new things every day. 
</p><p>Coming from a different county with different cultural background have taught me a lot and brought many changes to me personally. Here at Texas A&M I am a member of the Malaysian Student Association of<a href=" https://maroonlink.tamu.edu/organization/masa/">Malaysian Student Association</a>. I was also the vice president for the Student Government Association (SGA) at Blinn community college <a href=" http://www.blinn.edu/SLA/"> Student Leadership Activities </a>. 
I came to the United States when I was 18 years old and was all alone. I learned many new things and learned how to be responsible and become an independent woman. I enjoy interacting with people and learning about their culture and society. Being in the United States at a very young age had taught me not only to be a confident person but it has also taught me to be a strong and an independent woman. I look forward to what the future holds for me, as I am really excited and looking forward to graduate.</p>
